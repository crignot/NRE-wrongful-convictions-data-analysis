# Exoneration Data Cleaning – Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed to clean and preprocess data from the **National Registry of Exonerations (NRE)**.  
Due to confidentiality, the raw datasets are not included here (text extraction and parsing were implemented in Python but are also omitted due to legal confidentiality).
These scripts are provided for transparency and reproducibility of the methods used.
